# 🚀 Autonomous Lunar Landing Using Deep Q-Networks (DQN)

This project explores the development of an **autonomous control system** using **Deep Q-Learning (DQN)**, applied to a simulated lunar landing environment. The goal is to train an intelligent agent that can safely land a spacecraft on the moon, dealing with gravity, momentum, and obstacles — all without any prior knowledge of the environment.

## 🧠 Why This Project Matters

Safe landing is one of the most challenging problems in aerospace robotics. From moon missions to Mars landings, systems must make decisions in real-time using only sensor data. This project uses **reinforcement learning**, specifically DQN, to replicate this decision-making capability in a simulated environment. It reflects real-world applications like autonomous drones, rovers, and spacecraft landing systems.

## 🧪 What Was Implemented

### ✅ Core Components:
- A fully working **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** built using **TensorFlow/Keras**
- Integration with **OpenAI Gym’s LunarLander-v2** environment
- Agent architecture: a **multi-layer perceptron** acting as a Q-function approximator
- Experience replay buffer and target network for stability

### 🔁 Training Loop Includes:
- Epsilon-greedy policy for exploration vs. exploitation  
- Batch sampling from replay buffer  
- Q-value target computation with Bellman Equation  
- Periodic updates of target network

---

## 🎮 The Environment

- **Observation Space**: 8 continuous variables (position, velocity, angle, etc.)
- **Action Space**: 4 discrete actions (do nothing, fire left engine, fire main engine, fire right engine)
- **Reward Function**:
  - Positive for landing and slowing descent
  - Negative for crashing or using fuel inefficiently
- **Success Criteria**: Land gently between landing flags without crashing

---

## 📈 Results and Observations

- The agent starts with random behavior but gradually learns to control the descent.
- After training, it demonstrates smooth and fuel-efficient landings.
- A reward threshold of **200+** indicates successful learning.

You can visualize:
- Episode rewards over time
- Landing trajectories
- How epsilon decreases with episodes
